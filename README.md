This repo contains all the work I completed in the summer of 2025 internship at IIT Hyderabad. A brief description of the project is as follows.

This project introduces a Neural Black-Scholes Model, a hybrid, grey-box modelling approach, through which we aim to overcome the shortcomings faced by the classical Black-Scholes model.
The goal is to incorporate a Neural Network corrective term into the Black Scholes partial differential equation (PDE), solve it backwards in time, to show that it can improve upon the predictions of the classical Black-Scholes model.

The report contains a detailed methodology of the project and the .ipynb contains the implementation of the project.
